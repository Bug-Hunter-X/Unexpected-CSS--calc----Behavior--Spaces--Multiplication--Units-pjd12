The CSS property `calc()` is used to perform calculations. However, sometimes unexpected results occur due to incorrect use of spaces, missing multiplication signs, or unit mismatch. For instance, using `width: calc(100% - 10px)` works fine, but `width: calc(100%-10px)` will fail because of missing spaces. Similarly, `height: calc(20px + 10%)` is correct, but `height: calc(20px+10%)` is wrong.  Another common mistake is forgetting a multiplication sign when using variables or percentages. For example, instead of `width:calc(50% * 2)`, you might write `width:calc(50% *2)`, which is invalid.  Lastly, unit mismatches cause unexpected behavior.  `width:calc(100px + 10%)` is valid, but `width: calc(100px + 10em)` could cause unpredictable results depending on the context.
